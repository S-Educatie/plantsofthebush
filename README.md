# plantsofthebush
Plants of the Bush is a project at Burgers' Zoo to monitor the flowering and fruiting patterns of plants housed in their Bush exhibit. The code in this repository was (and hopefully still is) being used in an online tool that allows citizen-scientists to easily input data during surveys. This tool was part of a graduate internship with the Forest Ecology and Forest Management Group at Wageningen University &amp; Research.

## How to run
If you would like to run the code, simply use the command:
- `flask --app plants --debug run`
